			So, can we formulate \alert{tractable}, \alert{dynamical} models of community structure in networks?

		  	Network $G$, nodes with opinions $\{\ell_i\}$. Each time-step:
		  	\begin{itemize}
		  		\item \textbf{Mutation}: With probability $\lambda$, flip a node's opinion.
		  		\item \textbf{Rewiring}: With probability $(1-\lambda)\alpha$, rewire a \textbf{discordant} edge between two nodes that disagree. 
		  		\item \textbf{Vote}: With probability $(1-\alpha)(1-\lambda)$, a node attached to a discordant discordant edge changes its opinion.
